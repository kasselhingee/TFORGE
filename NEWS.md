## Version 0.1.14
Further polishing thanks to review from Benjamin Altmann:

+ Updated method to describe license
+ Mentioned manuscript title in description
+ Return value described for all functions

Also:
+ corrected the `standardise_` function names to start with `translate` (to match manuscript language)
+ renamed `bootresampling()` to `boot_calib()` (to also match language in manuscript)
`normalise_trace()` now only works on fsm-like inputs to match `project_trace()` and `normalise_ss1()`.

## Version 0.1.13
Polishing of package for CRAN. Primarily much shorter unit tests (and a way to test quickly locally too).

## Version 0.1.12
Version submitted to JASA
