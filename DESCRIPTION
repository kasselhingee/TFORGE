Description: When observations are symmetric matrices (also called tensors) the eigenvalues are often of interest. This package offers single sample tests for the eigenvalues of the population mean or the eigenvalue-multiplicity of the population mean. For k-samples this package offers tests for equal eigenvalues between samples. Included is support for matrices with constraints common to geophysical tensors (constant trace, sum of squared eigenvalues, or both). The most flexible tests in this package use pivotal bootstrap methods. Also available is a 2-sample test using a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble approximation and an eigenvalue-multiplicity test assuming orthogonally-invariant covariance.
