Thank you for the review. I've fixed up all of Beni Altmann's requests.

On referencing my manuscript:
In the DESCRIPTION I've added a partial reference to the manuscript, but no DOI nor URL yet as the paper isn't on the journal website yet (and in fact the manuscript is waiting for a URL of this submitted package on CRAN). I will update the DESCRIPTION with full reference, DOI etc once it is available.
This package is associated with a manuscript recently accepted by the Journal of the American Statistical Association. The package will be updated with a DOI/URL when it is available.

On the LICENSE file:
I've omitted the LICENSE file that was largely repeating GPL-3, but I've added a small LICENSE.note file to explain that ./R/scel.R is BSD-3. I hope I'm doing this correctly for CRAN. I've also added a comment to Art B. Owen and Leland Stanford Junior University noting that their copyright is only for ./R/scel.R.
